15,15,"The first 1000 km is a crucial part of the scooter's operation. Proper running-in during this period helps to ensure maximum life and smooth performance. The reliability and performance of the scooter depends on the special care and restraint exercised during the running-in period. It is especially important to avoid operating the engine at high speed (RPM), which could expose the engine parts to excessive stress. The recommended speed during the running-in period is a maximum of 50 km/h up to 1000 km (varying the engine speed for better mating of parts). The first free service at 500-750 km is most important. During the running-in period, all engine components and other parts will have set in. All adjustments should be restored, all fasteners should be tightened, and the engine and transmission oil should be replaced. Timely performance of the first free service will ensure optimum service life and performance from the engine. Replacing the engine and transmission oil during the first service is most important for better engine life. Always use TVS TRU4 SKUUTA (SAE 10W30 API-SL, JASO MB) oil for better performance and life. Caution.",242
16,16,"""Safe riding tips and recommendations for two-wheeler riders include: familiarizing oneself with the new TVS Jupiter 125, wearing good quality two-wheeler riding apparel, knowing one's limits, wearing an ISI approved helmet that fits the head comfortably and securely, and wearing good quality goggles to protect the eyes and improve vision. Additionally, it is important to never consume alcohol or drugs before or during the operation of the vehicle, as even minimal consumption can affect the rider's ability to control the vehicle.""",101
17,17,"Proper vehicle riding starts with proper posture: keep elbows relaxed and flexible, sit and adjust on seat so that arms and shoulders are relaxed, look widely instead of gazing at one point, keep both hands firmly on the handle bar and both feet securely on the floor board, avoid use of mobile phones while riding, slow down to a safe speed before negotiating a corner, practice on a safe, open area to become thoroughly familiar with the operation of the vehicle. Cornering: reduce speed to lessen the effects of centrifugal force, avoid abrupt application of brake or sudden steering. Braking: close/release the throttle, hold the vehicle upright as you apply the brake, progressive application of brake is safer, apply both the brakes, close throttle and come to a slower speed while riding down hills, cornering and wet roads to avoid loss of control over the vehicle due to skidding.",176
18,18,"Cause of poor braking: 
1. Insufficient friction is generated if brake shoes/pads or drum/disc are worn out or if there is water or oil on them. 
2. Poor braking can also occur if the road surface is wet or the tyre surface is worn-out, as tyres do not take a firm hold on the surface, increasing the stopping distance. 
3. Approximately 60% of braking effect is from the front brake, so non-usage of the front brake can cause poor braking. 
4. As the vehicle speed increases, the stopping distance also increases progressively. 
5. Using only the front or rear brake is dangerous and can cause skidding and loss of control. 
6. Both brakes should be applied together and with great care on a wet road or other slippery surfaces. 
7. Abrupt braking on slippery or irregular roads can cause loss of rider control. 
8. Use extreme caution while selecting and installing accessories for the scooter, as the addition of unsuitable accessories can lead to unsafe operating conditions. 
9. Make sure that the accessories should not obstruct lighting, steering, suspension level and ground clearance. 
10. Additional electrical equipment is not acceptable as it will void the warranty terms of the vehicle.",263
19,19,"All TVS vehicles are tested in the factory for optimal fuel efficiency and CO levels. If adjustments are needed, the owner should consult a TVS Motor Company Authorised Main Dealer/Authorised Dealer.

42,42,"Engine oil and transmission oil are important for the proper functioning of a vehicle. Dirty or less engine oil increases friction between various parts of the engine and reduces engine life, resulting in increased fuel consumption. Running with low transmission oil will cause damage to the gears and bearings. Regularly inspect the engine oil and transmission oil for correct level and top-up if necessary. Get it replaced at regular intervals as per the maintenance schedule. Inspect and arrest fuel leaks if any from tank and fuel lines. Vehicle parked in the hot sun leads to wastage of fuel through evaporation. Ensure to close fuel tank cap after every filling. Low tyre pressure has adverse effect on the vehicle, resulting in decreased fuel economy. Inspect the tyre pressure regularly (weekly) and inflate it to the recommended pressure. Inspect and ensure the wheel freeness by rotating the wheels at least once in a week to avoid wastage of fuel. While waiting for someone or stopping in signals for long time, if the engine is kept running at idle speed, it causes unnecessary wastage of fuel. Anticipate corners and slopes as well as the traffic conditions. Unnecessary and frequent braking will reduce the fuel economy. Never accelerate and apply brake simultaneously. It leads to clutch shoes wear and wastage of fuel.",255
43,43,"41MAINTENANCE: MAINTENANCE SCHEDULE indicates the intervals between periodic services. At the end of each interval, inspect, check, replace, adjust, lubricate and service as instructed. If maintenance is not done periodically, it will result in rapid wear and severe damage to the vehicle. If vehicle is used under high stress conditions such as continuous full throttle operation or if used/operated in dusty climate, certain jobs should be performed more often to ensure reliability of the vehicle. Cylinder head, steering components, suspension and wheel components etc., are key items and require very special and careful servicing.
