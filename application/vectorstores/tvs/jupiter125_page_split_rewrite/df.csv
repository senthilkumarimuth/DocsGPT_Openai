Additionally, it is important to never consume alcohol or drugs before or during the operation of the vehicle, as even minimal consumption can affect the rider's ability to control the vehicle.""",101,"14SAFE RIDING TIPS
SAFE RIDING RECOMMENDATIONS
Any two wheeler riding requires some precautions to be taken to ensure the safety of the rider, pillion rider and other 
road users. These precautions are: 
Familiarise yourself with new TVS Jupiter 125
Riding skill and your mechanical knowledge form the foundation of safe riding practices. We suggest you to practice 
riding TVS Jupiter 125 in a low-traffic condition until you are thoroughly familiar with your vehicle and its controls. 
Remember practice makes you perfect. 
Riding apparel
Loose, fancy clothing can be uncomfortable and unsafe when riding a two-wheeler. Choose good quality two wheeler 
riding apparel.
Know your limits
Ride within the boundaries of your own skill at all times. Knowing these limits and staying within them will help you 
avoid accidents.
T wo wheeler safety starts with wearing a good quality helmet . One of the most serious injuries that can happen is a 
head injury. Always wear an ISI approved helmet that should fit your head comfortably and securely. You should also have 
good quality goggles to protect your eyes and help your vision.
To prevent or minimize accident, never consume alcohol or drugs before or during the operation of your vehicle. Even minimal 
consumption of these will affect the rider’s ability to control the vehicle.Warning"
19,17,"Proper vehicle riding starts with proper posture: keep elbows relaxed and flexible, sit and adjust on seat so that arms and shoulders are relaxed, look widely instead of gazing at one point, keep both hands firmly on handle bar and both feet securely on floor board, avoid use of mobile phones while riding, slow down to a safe speed before negotiating a corner, practice on a safe, open area to become familiar with operation of vehicle, reduce speed when cornering to lessen effects of centrifugal force, avoid abrupt application of brake or sudden steering, master braking techniques by closing/releasing throttle, holding vehicle upright as applying brake, progressive application of brake is safer, and apply both brakes (SBT provides additional braking even when only rear brake is applied).",150,"15
15Posture
Proper vehicle riding starts with proper posture.
1. Keep your elbows relaxed and flexible.
2. Sit and adjust yourself on seat so that arms and 
shoulders are relaxed.
3. Look widely instead of gazing at one point.
One-hand riding is dangerous.  Keep both hands firmly 
on the handle bar and both feet securely on the floor 
board. Under no circumstances should both the hands 
be removed from the handle bar, as it is very dangerous.
Avoid use of mobile phones while riding as it could 
lead to fatal accident.
Slow down to a safe speed before negotiating a corner. 
If this is the first time that you are riding a vehicle of this 
type, we suggest that you practice on a safe, open area 
to become thoroughly familiar with the operation of the 
vehicle.WarningCornering
When cornering, centrifugal force works in a direction 
perpendicular to the direction in which the vehicle 
is moving. Centrifugal force increases in proportion 
with speed and the radius of the corner.
During cornering, reduce speed so as to lessen the 
effects of centrifugal force. By all means, avoid abrupt 
application of brake or sudden steering.
Braking
For safe riding, it is very important to master the 
braking techniques.
1. Close / release the throttle.
2. Hold the vehicle upright as you apply the brake.
3. Progressive application of brake is safer.
4. Apply both the brakes. ‘SBT’ provides additional 
braking even when ‘only rear brake’ is applied,"
20,17,"Hold the vehicle upright while applying the brake. Apply the brake progressively for safety. Apply both the brakes, as 'SBT' provides additional braking when only the rear brake is applied, but applying both brakes allows for the full potential of the brakes to be used. When riding down hills, cornering, and on wet roads, close the throttle and reduce speed to avoid skidding and loss of control over the vehicle.",84,"2. Hold the vehicle upright as you apply the brake.
3. Progressive application of brake is safer.
4. Apply both the brakes. ‘SBT’ provides additional 
braking even when ‘only rear brake’ is applied, 
But applying ‘both the brakes’ helps you to use 
the full potential of the brakes.
5. Riding down hills, while cornering and wet roads, 
close throttle and come to a slower speed to 
avoid the loss of control over the vehicle due to 
skidding."
21,18,"Cause of poor braking: 
1. Insufficient friction is generated if brake shoes/pads or drum/disc are worn out or if there is water or oil on them. 
2. Poor braking can also occur if the road surface is wet or the tyre surface is worn-out, as tyres do not take a firm hold on the surface, increasing the stopping distance. 
3. Approximately 60% of braking effect is from the front brake, so non-usage of the front brake can cause poor braking. 
4. As the vehicle speed increases, the stopping distance also increases progressively. 
5. Using only the front or rear brake is dangerous and can cause skidding and loss of control. 
6. Both brakes should be applied together and with great care on a wet road or other slippery surfaces. 
7. Abrupt braking on slippery or irregular roads can cause loss of rider control. 
8. When selecting and installing accessories for the scooter, extreme caution should be taken to ensure that the accessories do not obstruct lighting, steering, suspension level and ground clearance. 
9. Adding additional electrical equipment is not acceptable as it will void the warranty terms of the vehicle.",248,"16Causes for poor braking
1. If the brake shoes / pads or drum / disc are worn 
out or if there is water or oil on them, sufficient 
friction does not develop and brakes do not work 
well.
2. Even when the brake works normally, if the road 
surface is wet or the tyre surface is worn-out, 
tyres do not take a firm hold on the surface, 
increasing the stopping distance.
3. Approximately 60% braking effect is from front 
brake. Non-usage of front brake causes poor 
braking.
As the vehicle speed increases, the stopping distance 
also increases progressively. Be sure that, you have 
sufficient distance between you and the vehicle or 
obstruction ahead of you.
Using only the front or rear brake is dangerous and can 
cause skidding and loss of control. Apply both the 
brakes together and with great care on a wet road or 
other slippery surfaces . Any abrupt braking on slippery 
or irregular roads can cause loss of rider control.WarningACCESSORY INSTALLATION AND SAFETY TIPS
Use extreme caution while selecting and installing 
the accessories for your scooter.
The addition of unsuitable accessories can lead to 
unsafe operating conditions.  Your friendly Dealer 
will assist you in selecting quality accessories and 
installing them correctly.
While selecting the accessories, make sure that the 
accessories should not obstruct lighting, steering, 
suspension level and ground clearance.
Additional electrical equipments is not acceptable 
as it will void the warranty terms of the vehicle."

For cold conditions, the front tyre pressure should be 1.68 kg/cm² (24 PSI) and the rear tyre pressure should be 2.25 kg/cm² (32 PSI) for solo tyres, and 1.68 kg/cm² (24 PSI) for the front tyre and 2.53 kg/cm² (36 PSI) for the rear tyre for dual tyres. Operating the vehicle with excessively worn tyres can decrease riding stability and lead to loss of control. Replace the tyre when the tyre wears off to the tyre wear indicator level (indicated by TWI (A) on the tyre). When reassembling the tyres, after removing from the wheel rim, ensure that the arrow mark is facing the direction of wheel rotation while fixing the tyre on the wheel rim. 57TYRES are fitted with tubeless tyres on both front and rear wheels.

57TYRES
T yre pressure
Check the tyre pressure atleast once in a week if 
not more frequently. Insufficient air pressure in the 
tyres not only hasten the tyre wear, but also seriously 
affects the stability of the vehicle.
Under inflated tyres make smooth cornering difficult 
and over inflated tyres decreases the tyre contact 
with the ground which can lead to skidding and loss 
of control.
Be sure that the tyre pressure is within the specified 
limit at all times.
